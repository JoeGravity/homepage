Built on a HEAVILY modified template, using Bootstrap, jQuery and JS (plus HTML & CSS). Frankensteined together with Nivo Slider and Colorbox portfolio preview scripting.

I used this before I graduated my Coding Boot Camp in 2018 for my personal portfolio website because it was free and needed no database backend.
